WordsCounter
This app is designed to download an HTML page and display statistics on the number of unique words in the console

To launch the app, use the class WordsCounterApp.class.

To get statistics on the number of unique words, enter the URL.

The app splits the page text into individual words using a list of delimiters: {' ', ',', '.', '! ', '?','"', ';', ':', '[', ']', '(', ')', '\n', '\r', '\t'};

The project is implemented using java core.

In the future, it is planned to add the JSOUP, log4j and JUNIT libraries, and implement data saving to the database.
